# Final project for STAT9700
Dimension reduction (DR) algorithms are extensively employed in visualizing high dimensional datasets, yet they can result in distortions that obscure accurate interpretations. This study demonstrates that DynamicViz, which employs bootstrap sampling, can alleviate visualization artifacts, offering more consistent representations. However, its effectiveness is bound by the constraints of the chosen DR technique. In contrast, MetaVis, which integrates multiple visualizations into an ensemble, shows potential in creating more faithful visualizations, particularly effective when Euclidean distances among data points accurately reflect the dataset's underlying structure. The research, encompassing simulations of tetrahedron clusters, a Swiss roll, and two single-cell datasets, explores the strengths and limitations of these two techniques, providing insights into their applicability across different contexts. It is notable that MetaVis, while promising, does not consistently excel over individual methods and may introduce new distortions, especially when the complex data structure is not well-represented by global Euclidean distances. This underscores the importance of considering the intrinsic structure of the data when applying DR techniques and points to the need for developing more robust methods that can reliably preserve the intricate topological and geometric properties of high-dimensional data.
